# VenSipher
VenSipher is a free medium through which text can be enciphered. It can convert any text into an unrecognizable secret text that can only be deciphered by someone who has the auto-generated code along with the generated cipher. The secret text is different each time it's generated (even for the same text), making it impossible to decipher. It's well-designed and simple to use.
